Thereby leading to a better understanding of your product and your customer. \\r\\n\\r\\nABBY offers a front-end that makes it easy to edit, delete or create tests and to add evaluation results. Further, it provides a RESTful API to integrate directly with our platform to easily handle A/B tests without touching the front-end. Another notable feature is the possibility to upload a CSV file and have the A/B test auto-evaluated, although this feature is considered highly experimental.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Jimdo, a do-it-yourself website builder, we have a team of about 180 people from different countries and with professional backgrounds just as diverse. Therefore it is crucial to have tools that allow having a common perspective on the tests. This facilitates having data informed discussions and to deduce effective solutions. In our opinion tools like ABBY are cornerstones to achieve the ultimate goal of being a data-driven company. It enables all our co-workers to review past and plan future tests to further improve our product and to raise the happiness of our customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed talk will give a detailed overview of ABBY, which eventually will be open-sourced, and its capabilities.

Of course, its name in English has a lot to do with this conception, but in other languages, like the french 'ordinateur' (which express concepts more like sorting or classifying), one can clearly see the other side of the coin: computers can also be used to extract (usually new) information from data.\\n\\nStorage, reduction, classification, selection, sorting, grouping, among others, are typical operations in this 'alternate' goal of computers, and although carrying out all these tasks does imply doing a lot of computations, it also requires thinking about the computer as a different entity than the view offered by the traditional von Neumann architecture (basically a CPU with memory).  In fact, when it is about programming the data handling efficiently, the most interesting part of a computer is the so-called hierarchical storage, where the different levels of caches in CPUs, the RAM memory, the SSD layers (there are several in the market already), the mechanical disks and finally, the network, are pretty much more important than the ALUs (arithmetic and logical units) in CPUs.\\n\\nIn data handling, techniques like data deduplication and compression become critical when speaking about dealing with extremely large datasets.  Moreover, distributed environments are useful mainly because of its increased storage capacities and I/O bandwidth, rather than for their aggregated computing throughput.\\n\\nDuring my talk I will describe several programming paradigms that should be taken in account when programming data oriented applications and that are usually different than those required for achieving pure computational throughput.

Various signal processing algorithms (so called nodes) are available within the software, from finite impulse response filters over data-dependent spatial filters (e.g., PCA, CSP, xDAWN) to established classifiers (e.g., SVM, LDA). pySPACE incorporates the concept of node and node chains of the Modular Toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) framework. Due to its modular architecture, the software can easily be extended with new processing nodes and more general operations. Large scale empirical investigations can be configured using simple text-configuration files in the YAML format, executed on different (distributed) computing modalities, and evaluated using an interactive graphical user interface.\\npySPACE allows the user to connect nodes modularly and automatically benchmark the respective chains for different parameter settings and compare these with other node chains, e.g., by automatic evaluation of classification performances provided within the software. In addition, the pySPACElive mode of execution can be used for online processing of streamed data. The software specifically supports but is not limited to EEG data. Any kind of time series or feature vector data can be processed and analyzed.\\npySPACE additionally provides interfaces to specialized signal processing libraries such as SciPy, scikit-learn, LIBSVM, the WEKA Machine Learning Framework, and the Maja Machine Learning Framework (MMLF).\\nWeb page: http://pyspace.github.io/pyspace/\\n',\n",

Big Data can be a troublesome phrase, arguably more hype than anything at this point, it has many different meanings, but for the purpose of this tutorial we\\u2019ll consider it to be any data that is too large to fit into the main memory of a single machine. With that in mind, if you\\u2019ve ever found yourself with the need to process an amount of data that stretched the boundaries of your own personal laptop, and you wanted to apply the ideas expressed in Dean's and Ghemawat's seminal paper but had no idea what to do, or even where to start, then this tutorial is for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of the tutorial is to give attendees a basic working knowledge of what MapReduce is, and how it can be used to process massive sets of data relatively quickly. We will walk through the basics of what MapReduce is and how it works. Though there are a handful of MapReduce implementations out there to choose from, Hadoop is without a doubt the most well known and, as such, we will take a look at how to use it to run our MapReduce jobs. With that in mind, we will discuss what you need to know to use Hadoop and take a look at how to write our own Hadoop jobs in Python using the Hadoop Streaming utility. Finally, we\\u2019ll look at a library created at Yelp called MRJob that can make writing Hadoop jobs in Python much easier. By the end of the tutorial an attendee with little to no knowledge of MapReduce, but a working knowledge of Python, should be able to write their own basic MapReduce tasks for Hadoop and run them on a cluster of machines using Amazon\\u2019s Elastic MapReduce service.\\r\\n\\n                \",\n",

Visualization, animation, and interaction can be gainfully employed to develop information systems that are both useful, enabling users to get the job done well, and usable, empowering users to do job with ease. Effective information visualization should be immediately appealing to the eye and directly relevant to the task, routinely enjoyable to the user and uniquely valuable to the business.

One of the outcomes of this discussion was Tulip, an asynchronous programming API for Python 3.3, spearheaded by Guido van Rossum. A lesser known outcome was PyParallel: a set of modifications to the CPython interpreter that allows Python code to execute concurrently across multiple cores.\\nTwisted, Tulip, Gevent, Stackless/greenlets and even node.js are all variations on the same pattern for achieving \"asynchronous I/O\": non-blocking I/O performed on a single thread. Each framework provides extensive mechanisms for encapsulating computational work via deferreds, coroutines, generators and yield from clauses that can be executed in the future when a file descriptor is ready for reading or writing.\\nWhat I found troubling with all these solutions is that so much effort was being invested to encapsulate future computation (to be executed when a file descriptor is ready for reading or writing), without consideration of the fact that execution is still limited to a single core.\\nPyParallel approaches the problem in a fundamentally different way. Developers will still write code in such a way that they\\'re encapsulating future computation via the provided APIs, however, thanks to some novel CPython interpreter modifications, such code can be run concurrently across all available cores.\\nThis talk will cover the history behind PyParallel, the numerous novel techniques invented to achieve concurrent interpreter execution, real-life examples of PyParallel in action (multi-threaded HTTP servers, parallel task decomposition). It will detail the approach PyParallel takes towards facilitating asynchronous I/O compared to competing libraries like Twisted and Tulip.

Unfortunately, the array-based datasets central to many applications do not fit neatly into classic relational or  key-value paradigm of popular database architectures. Enter SciDB, a new database platform which is built around large multi-dimensional arrays. It provides both efficient distributed storage and fast array-oriented computations, from simple slices and joins to more involved parallel linear algebraic operations.

How do we take a language that prides itself on readability and ease-of-use, and apply it to cutting edge challenges like cluster computing, multi-core processors, and GPUs?  Are there fundamental limitations - do we have to move to a different language for these things?\\nThe second topic is the challenge of scaling the *usage* of Python across a team or an organization.  Oftentimes, Python is chosen by the early prototypers in a team, and as they succeessfuly deploy their code into production, more and more people - who do not necessarily possess the mindset of the early evangelists - start needing to use or adopt the language, without necessarily having \"organically\" grown an appreciation for its idioms.  Sometimes the code they produce more closely resembles Java or C++, but just spelled in Python.  How can experienced Python programmers help grow the effective usage of the language across the organization?\\nThese are two very different questions, but they are both rooted in a common theme: Python\\'s ease of use and its power as a scripting language is actually a double-edged sword.  Since people are used to things being much easier and more pleasant to code in Python, when they run into traditionally challenging problems like distributed computing or software management, there is a tendency to just assume that Python is \"really bad\" for that use case.  But Python can be successfully scaled across a cluster and across and organization.  In this panel discussion, we\\'ll talk about lessons learned in both of these situations.\\n',\n",

Graphics primitives to draw rectangles, lines, and text, in addition to generating sounds, allow algorithm visualizations that enhance the understanding of the algorithm.\\nIntended usage for PyAlgoViz is in the Datastructures and Algorithm track of the Computer Science curriculum or for personal education in the area of program algorithms. Not only will students learn how to implement algorithms in Python, they will also will be able to better understand asymptotic or even buggy algorithms by inducing patterns from observing the visualizations they create themselves.\\nTechnologies used to develop PyAlgoViz were MacVIM, Google App Engine, Python 2.7, Python NBD DataStore, , HTML/JavaScript/CSS, CodeMirror, jQuery, and .\\n',\n",
