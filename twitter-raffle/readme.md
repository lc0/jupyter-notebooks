## Deciding on the best tweet

While organizing [**GDG DevFest Bayern**](https://bayern.devfest.de/) we wanted to engage with Twitter
the same time to share some swag with our attendees.
And as just using [random](https://www.random.org/lists/) would be boring, we decided to give away some swag to the most liked/retweeted tweets that used the event hashtag.

This [notebook](raffle.ipynb) was written to solve this problem. In order to run the notebook:

```bash
make run
```

The same notebook was also used to present the winners on the stage.
For that, we used *slideshow* part of Jupyter. In order to serve these slides as revel.js slides run:

```bash
make serve
```
